# Codewars Problems

## Description
This repo is simply a container to document my daily codewars challenges.

It's primary purpose is a reference to keep track of novel solutions and sharpen my algorithmic problem solving abilities, specifically in JavaScript. 

It's secondary, longterm, function is to be a resource for others looking for a collection of problems to challenge themselves. It is currently not structured like the secondary function, all problems are solved and full of my notes. 

## Setup
1. Clone repo onto local device.
2. Download latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
3. To test/solve any file, run `node filename.js` in CLI.
