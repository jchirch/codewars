// The maximum sum subarray problem consists in finding 
// the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array or list of integers:

// maxSequence([-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4])
// should be 6: [4, -1, 2, 1]

// clairifying ?s: always whole numbers? should i make a guard clause?
// what happens with an array with <= 2 numbers?
